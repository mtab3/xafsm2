# In this definition file,
# for any item, you can use "" (double quotation marks) as you want,
# though, it cause no difference use or not use the "" basically.
# The "" is necessary only when you define strings with 'space'.
# For example, the notation SENSOR and "SENSOR" cause no difference.
# However, when the key-word includes 'space', the "" is essentially important.
# For example, "Keithley 6485" can not be writtern Keithley 6485.
